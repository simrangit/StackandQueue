# StackandQueue

There are 2 files - Stack.java and Queue.java.

1. Stack.java - The 2 main operations are performed using Array. The operations are performed in LIFO (Last In First Out).

    A. Push - Adds an element to the end of stack, if the space exists. It does not add an element if there is no space -> "Stack is full".
    
    B. Pop - Deletes an element from the end of stack. If stack is empty, it displays -> "Stack is empty".
    
    C. Print - This prints the array if it contain elements.
    
2. Queue.java (Circular) - The 2 main operations are performed using Array. The operations are performed in FIFO (First in First Out).

    A. Enqueue - Adds an element to the end (rear) of queue, if the space exists. It does not add an element, if there is no space -> "Queue is full".
    
    B. Dequeue - Deletes an element from the front (start) position, where the first element was inserted. If queue is empty, it displays -> "Queue is empty".
    
    C. Print - This prints the elements present in the array from front->rear position.
